### PM Reflection

1. How did you come up with your idea?

As an accounting concentration at Babson College, I noticed there are ltos of struggles personally and for other students to understand the requirements for accounting at Babson and how it differs to the requirements for career. I thought creating a comprehensive website would be super helpful for students to fully understand what they need to do to be successful in accounting and at Babson/.

2. How well did the collaboration with your developer work?

The collaboration went very well with my developer, John was super attentive to all of the detials in my wireframes and asked very good follow up questions to make sure the project played out exactly how I wanted to. Would work with John again if the opportunity came about.

3. What did you learn about writing requirements?

I learned that in writing requirments, one should be very specific in details because creating a website is very up to a creative imagination. On the oter hand, requirements need to be detailed, yet not too lengthy. It should be a list of required items within the website and brief ideas for how to make the website more complex. 

4. Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?

I used AI to help me summarize my ideas in the PRD better.

### Dev Reflection
1. How did you interpret and implement someone elseâ€™s idea?

I ws unsure about the climbing world in general, so I started by asking Andrew about this world first to understand how te website has actual use for him and others. Then, I took a look at the wireframes and began the code the html for the website followed by the css and javascript code. Whenever, I got stuck I used AI to help me think through the problem. I thought it was pretty straightforward to implement Andrew's idea considering I was given a great PRD and wireframe to go off of.

2. What were the challenges in development and collaboration?

I tested my knowledge and limits in this project attempting to implement things I have never done before, like creating an upload photo button and linking this button to the photos in my files on my computer. Communication with the PM was very easy as he was super responsive and positive in answering my questions.

3. Which parts did you use AI tools for, and what did you learn from that?

Whenever I got stuck, I used AI to help me develop the code and explain why the code is how it is. Also, if I wrote the code myself and it did not work, then I used AI to ask why it didn't work and how to fix it.
