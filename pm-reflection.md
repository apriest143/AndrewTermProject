PM reflection prompts:
How did you come up with your idea?
Climbing has been a big passion of mine for a while. However, I suffered a moderate injury and wanted to better document my progress as I returned

How well did the collaboration with your developer work?
Quite well, we were able to use both slack and github to raise any concerns or ask for clarification if it was ever needed. Responses were effective and quick between us.

What did you learn about writing requirements?
There is no such thing as too much information. When building out a website with complex or specific functionality, having more to go off of in terms of styling or exact processes is very helpful. I also realized that the creation of a website and a paragraph description of it differs greatly, meaning that if a PM and a DEV arent on the same page, things can go off course quickly

Did you use any AI tools in this process? How?
No I did not.
